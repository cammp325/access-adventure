## Access Adventure
A react-native project 

## Project Goal:

This team project aims to build an outdoor app for adventure seekers and provide all online users seamless access to an experience-driven platform that allows them to connect to a community of outdoor enthusiasts and find a match on criteria simply beyond location.
 
## High-level features:

[x] The system will have a login page (single sign-on (SSO) will have extra points if implemented)—there should be a DB handling encrypted user data.


[...] Users will be able to create and delete the profile and upload photos.

[] The system will allow users to connect their profiles to Instagram and other social media.

[] The system will collect information about a user, including parameters related to the type
of adventure, skill level, preferences, and attitude. Examples of adventures include skiing,
backpacking, travel, hiking, holidate, etc. 

[] The system will have a matching engine/algorithm to effectively match users (through
swipe left and swipe right type of mechanism) with others that suit their adventure, skills,
and behaviors within their selected mile range.

[] The system will have an in-app messaging to enable users to coordinate an outing or
simply chat with a match (voice note, audio, and video calls options will have extra
points if implemented).
